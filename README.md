#Development of the visualisation using power bi is developing

A Ride-Sharing Data Analysis Project
Overview
This project analyzes ride-sharing data from OLA, focusing on booking patterns, customer behavior, vehicle preferences, and service performance metrics. The analysis is performed using SQL for data querying and Power BI for visualization (development in progress).
Dataset Structure
The dataset contains 100,000 rows of ride-sharing data from Bengaluru city, including the following key information:

Booking details (ID, status, date, time)
Customer information
Vehicle types (Auto, Prime Plus, Prime Sedan, Mini, Bike, eBike, Prime SUV)
Location data (50 areas in Bangalore)
Ride metrics (distance, value, ratings)
Cancellation and incomplete ride information

Key Data Parameters

Overall booking success rate: 62%
Customer cancellation rate: < 7%
Driver cancellation rate: < 18%
Incomplete rides: < 6%
Order value distribution:

Under 500: 70%
500-1000: 28%
Above 1000: 2%
